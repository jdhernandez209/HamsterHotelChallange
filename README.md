I see that you made your NavBar spacing very similar to the prototype.  <br>
I cant seem to get the picture for the hero image to show but I think thats because of the folder I chose to clone your work into and its not pointing to the correct folder now. <br>
Your Overview section looks good. <br>
Your Rooms section seems to need some gap between the cards by maybe using gx-2 or g-2.  And again, the background isnt showing for me but I think because of the different folder that I put the project in<br>
Your packages section seems to need to be pushed to the right for the middle row, but otherwise its a nice section. <br>
Since the background is not showing, i see everything in white. <br>

I just download the zip of this github and I can see the images now.  So for everything that I mentioned about background images, disregard!!!
